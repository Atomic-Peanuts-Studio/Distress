# Distress
## Git rules
- whenever you're adding something, add it to a feature branch, and in a seperate script file
- never merge without asking, create a merge request first. These have to be approved by two people before they can be merged.
- the branches are named in snake case and reflect what the point of the branch is (i.e. adding_melee_weapon)
- each person has to only use their own scene
- don't change the Unity project settings, unless everyone agrees
- don't change prefabs without notifying the others
- never include visual studio code / visual studio settings folders in commits
- never include Unity user settings in commits
